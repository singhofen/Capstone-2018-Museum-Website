<p><strong>Along cam 1971, and the Email.</strong></p>

<p>The official Email system. The first email was shipped out buy a engineer named Ray Tomlinson. He established this way of communication by separating man and machine by using the &lsquo;@&rsquo; symbol. Interesting. Imagine if he used any other keyboard symbol? Ray Tomlinson is seen below.</p>

<p>This online form of communication was the used on the ARPANET. The ARPANET was the beginning of the official internet.</p>

<p>Next in came the &lsquo;Talkomatic&rsquo; in 1974. </p>

<p>It was developed in 1973 by Doug Brown using the PLATO System. The Talkomatic was similar to a chat room. Users were logged in and could see each other type text and commutate instantly, except it was text only. Sorry, no sideways smiley faces or Emoji's here ☹☹☹☹☹.</p>

<p><strong>The Bulletin Board Systems a.k.a. BBS, circa 1987.</strong></p>

<p>Using the BBS one was able to set up a modem connected computers. This allowed users to dial into and gain access to a terminal. The BBS allowed people to leave text messages and even upload and download files.</p>


<p>BBS's were in many cases just someone's home computer and they allowed access to it from them to communicate (obviously). Other cases of the BBS were vast network systems with tons of phone lines. Some were run commercially as well. The first BBS Software was developed by a guy named Ward Christensen.</p>
