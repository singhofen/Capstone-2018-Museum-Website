<h2><strong>1961- First communication</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>1961- The Time Sharing Systems.</strong></h2>

<p>Time Sharing was first developed in the early 1960's to allow many users to share a computer and its resources simultaneously. An example of this would be a mainframe computer that has many users signed in to it. A time sharing PC System were developed to provide an interactive way to use a PC for multiple users while only using that one CPU of the Mainframe. </p>
<br>
<p>The time sharing system provides the direct access to a large number of users where CPU time is divided among all the users on scheduled basis. The OS allocates a set of time to each user. When this time is expired, it passes control to the next user on the system. The time allowed is extremely small and the users are given the impression that they each have their own CPU and they are the sole owner of the CPU. This short period of time during that a user gets attention of the CPU; is known as a time slice or a quantum. </p>


<p>Few people realize the first computers were developed in the early 1900s, but computer networking didn&rsquo;t become publicly available until around 1961. With the innovation of computer networking, on-line communication was born. This is where 2 or more computers could communicate from far distances (or short) via a Computer Network.</p>

<p><strong>Compatible Time-Sharing Systems, 1961</strong></p>


<p>The first form of communication using a computer was done by using The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). It was developed at MIT&rsquo;s Computation Center. It was an OS which let several users share one mainframe computer and its resources.</p>

<p>The increasing number of users needing access to computers in the early 1960s leads to experiments in timesharing computer systems. Timesharing systems can support many users – sometimes hundreds – by sharing the computer with each user.</p>

<p>CTSS used a modified IBM 7090 mainframe computer that had two 32,768 (32K) 36-bit-word banks of core memory instead of the normal one. One bank was reserved for the time-sharing supervisory program, the other for user programs. </p>


<h3><center><strong>Features of CCTS: Time Sharing Systems</strong></center></h3>
<ul>
<li>CTSS had one of the first computerized text formatting utilities, called RUNOFF</li>
<li>CTSS had one of the first inter-user messaging implementations, possibly inventing email</li>
<li>CTSS had the text editor QED, with regular expressions</li>
<li>Printers, punched card readers</li>
<li>Two custom high-speed vector graphics displays</li>
<li>Programming Languages: FAP, MAD (Compiler), Fortran II -> MAD Code</li>
<li>File Systems: Four Modes: temporary, permanent, read-only class 1, and read-only class 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>File systems Explained: Read-only class 2 differed in that the user couldn't change the mode of these files. Files could also be linked from other directories than the user's directory.</p>


<p>CTSS was pre-email, and pre-internet, it included user to user communication functionality which is similar to email. From this Computer Networking was established.</p>

<h2><p><strong>CompuServe, 1969</strong></p></h2>



<p>Next came CompuServe. In 1969 CompuServe was the first major commercial online service in the US. This was a vast network with various resources that you could connect too.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Founded in 1969 as a computer time-sharing service, Columbus, Ohio-based CompuServe drove the initial emergence of the on-line service industry. In 1979, CompuServe became the first service to offer electronic mail capabilities and technical support to personal computer users. </p>

<p>This service had official chat rooms, discussion boards, and electronic mail. Of course, like all technology it died out due to advancements more specifically the establishment and growth of the internet.</p>


<p>CompuServe was also a world leader in other commercial services. One of these was the Financial Services group, which collected and consolidated financial data from myriad data feeds, including CompuStat, Disclosure, I/B/E/S as well as the price/quote feeds from the major exchanges. CompuServe developed extensive screening and reporting tools that were used by many investment banks on Wall Street.</p>
